"""Lambda Expressions

Small anonymous function can be created with the lambda keyword. Lambda functions can be used
wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression.
Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function definition. Like nested function
definitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope.
